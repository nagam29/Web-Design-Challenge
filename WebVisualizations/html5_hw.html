    <h1>Locations of Cities and Wind Speed</h1>

        <p>This chart presents the relationships between the locations of cities (by latitudes) and their average wind speed.
            The data was collected on Jan 5 2017. 
            Cities on the latitudes higher than 0 are those in the northern hemispher, and those on the latitudes lower than 0 are in 
            southern hemispher.
            The cities close to the equator seem to present the slower wind speeds than any other areas.
            Overall, the wind speeds of the majority of cities seem to be concentrated on lower than 10 mph. In addition, the cities in the higher 
            latitudes observe more extreme wind speeds such as faster than 35 mph. However, this relationship does not seem to be really strong.
